It uses some of the rhetorical block elements from the SALT Rhetorical Ontology  and the Ontology of Rhetorical Blocks."@en ;

  rdfs:comment """The Discourse Elements Ontology is an ontology for describing the major rhetorical elements of a document such as a journal article.  It is a subsidiary ontology that is imported into the Document Components Ontology, itself part of SPAR, the Semantic Publishing and Referencing Ontologies.
